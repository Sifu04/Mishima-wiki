      <h1>The Mishima History</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Mishima family was originally a warrior clan that served the Japanese Emperor. The clan's origins date back to the Heian period (794 - 1185) during the time of the Taira and Minamoto clans. The family later capitalized on the outbreak of World War II and built an industrial empire that focused on providing militaristic resources to Japan.

        After the war, Jinpachi Mishima started moving the focus of his corporation away from the military due to his growing distaste for unnecessary conflict, and instead focused more on martial arts training. He opened a personal dojo where he taught his own style of karate, the Mishima Style Fighting Karate. He taught both his son, Heihachi Mishima, and the young Kazumi, who was a member of the Hachijo Clan, a family of secret assassins that carried the Devil Gene in their blood.
        
        Heihachi and Kazumi formed a lasting bond and the two fell in love over time. They married and had a son named Kazuya Mishima. Jinpachi was involved in the early training of his grandson, and the two had great affection for one another. After Jinpachi was imprisoned and Kazumi killed however, Heihachi was the sole teacher of Kazuya and his adopted son, Lee Chaolan, and was cruel and hard on them, teaching them by the motto: "A fight is about who is left standing. Nothing else".
        
        Early History
        Kazumi realized that both her husband, and, if she failed to kill Heihachi, her son also, would become a threat to the world. In the event that her assassination on Heihachi failed, she asked Akuma, whom she once saved, to promise to kill them.
        
        Heihachi forcefully seized the control of the family corporation from Jinpachi and had him imprisoned underneath Hon-Maru, after Jinpachi had launched a coup to try and re-take his corporation. The same year, Kazumi was killed by Heihachi after she tried to assassinate him. Kazumi had tried to kill him earlier too, though he initially believed she had a split personality and was simply unwell. This was proven false when she revealed her devil form and stated she was actively trying to kill him to protect the world and that this had been her mission form the very start.
        
        A five-year-old Kazuya realized that Heihachi was responsible for killing his mother and became enraged. The young Kazuya then fought his father near a cliff in the same year and was beaten within an inch of his life. Suspecting that his son may also have the same "illness" that Kazumi had and possibly also to see if Kazuya was strong enough to be worthy of being his son, Heihachi tossed him off a cliff, leading to the beginning of the events of the Tekken series.
        
        After Kazuya survived the fall he climbed back up the cliff, and Heihachi continued to raise him. Heihachi adopted a son to be a rival for Kazuya, Lee Chaolan, wanting him to motivate Kazuya to keep pushing and bettering himself. Heihachi had seen Lee fighting on the streets of a Chinese city, and was impressed by his fighting skills and reflexes.[1] Heihachi's severe education for both of his sons drove them to master martial arts, but inspired a lasting hatred within both for Heihachi. Kazuya and Lee continue to rival and spurn each other in the present day, despite knowing it was their mutually hated father that put them up to this.
        
        Years later, Heihachi, to be fully sure that he himself was not involved in the transmission of what would become known as the Devil Gene, had a child with a Swedish woman. The child conceived of this union was Lars Alexandersson. Lars never showed any signs of carrying the Devil Gene, apparently ending Heihachi's interest in the child.</h5>
